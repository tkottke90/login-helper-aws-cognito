# AWS User Pool Login Tool

This tool allows for users to login to an AWS Cognito User Pool and displays the access tokens returned, allowing me to use those tokens when developing using API tools like Insomnia or Postman

## Getting Started

Since the application requires that applications be signed for Windows and MacOS - And I dont want to pay for that stuff to run this you will need to use npm.

### 1. Install Node Modules

```
npm install
```

### 2. Run Application
