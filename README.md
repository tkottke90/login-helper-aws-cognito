# AWS User Pool Login Tool

This tool allows for users to login to an AWS Cognito User Pool and displays the access tokens returned, allowing me to use those tokens when developing using API tools like Insomnia or Postman

## Installation

Both Windows and Mac require certificates to sign and build applications for their platforms.  Dont have money I want to burn on that so, sorry.

To install this package, download the repository and then run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a new package.  You can then access the application by find the applicaiton called `aws-login`
